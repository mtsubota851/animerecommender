## General Info
After obtaining the data containing all the anime shows in an excel spreadsheet, I uploaded it to my Jupyter Notebook.
I organized each show by the genre and cleaned out all of the unnecessary values in the dataset.

After analyzing all of the data, then I built the recommendation system.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7
* Jupyter Notebook

## How it Works
The user would then put in his or her favorite show. If the show is in the dataset, the program then gives back a numerous amount of shows within the same genre.
